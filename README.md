## Analysis of neuropeptide and hormone precursors in thoracic ganglia of female banana shrimp _Fenneropenaeus merguiensis_ during vitellogenesis

This repository provides code and software that used to analyzed the RNA-Seq data generated from the previous study (unpublished). The dataset is available in the NCBI BioProject [PRJNA611903](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA611903), containing RNA-Seq reads from F.merguiensis during the different stages of ovarian development. The code is providing in 2 sections:

* [de novo assembly and post-assembly process](https://github.com/JirathNuan/fmtg_neuropeptide/blob/master/assembly-and-post-assembly-process.md)
* [Transcriptome annotation, neuropeptide and hormone precursors analyses](https://github.com/JirathNuan/fmtg_neuropeptide/blob/master/annotation-and-ident-neuropeptide.md)
